# Old Android Dashcam Project (2015)

## This project probably wont build. It is just here to show I've done a small amount of Android development

An android project published for Lollipop, now removed from the store as I didn't update it (and maybe because only I used it).

Android re-did the camera API, so it won't run on current versions.

The project featured/ enabled learning of:

1. Working dashboard camera, that took videos in a loop, deleting old videos as necessary.
2. Use of other APIs such the accelerometer, to stop the camera in the even of a crash (optional).
3. Gradle build Product Flavours to publish 2 different styles of the same app. 
4. Custom styles and overrides.
5. Layout controls and exception handling.
6. Capability for internationalisation (see screenshots)
7. Deployment to Play Store


At the time it was on the Android Store, it was free. There are loads of dashcams out there. I just thought it would be an easy project to try some Android development.
